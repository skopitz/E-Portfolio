## About me

I’m Sarah Kopitz, a student in UBC’s Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM) program. I’m interested in geomatics and environmental work — land, forests, water, animals, and people.

I’ve always been interested in the land and the environment, and that’s why I chose to do a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science (Specialization in Forest Ecology) at the University of Winnipeg. During my undergrad, I started getting more interested in geomatics and realized I liked the spatial side of environmental work.

I like that geomatics can be both technical and creative. It gives me space to work through environmental questions while still thinking about how information is presented and understood.

Indigenous rights and land are also important to me, and they influence how I think about environmental work and mapping.
