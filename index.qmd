## About me

I’m Sarah Kopitz, a student in the Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM) program at the University of British Columbia. I’m interested in environmental work that connects land, forests, water, wildlife, and people.

I completed a BSc in Environmental Science (Specialization in Forest Ecology) at the University of Winnipeg. During my undergrad, I became drawn to the spatial side of environmental work.

Geomatics stands out to me because it’s both technical and creative. I enjoy the problem solving side, and I also like how data can be communicated in different ways. 

Indigenous rights and land are important to me, and they shape how I think about environmental work.
