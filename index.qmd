## About me

I’m Sarah Kopitz, a student in UBC’s Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM) program at the University of British Columbia. I’m interested in geomatics and environmental work - land, forests, water, animals, and people.

I’ve always been interested in the land and the environment, and that’s why I chose to do a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science (Specialization in Forest Ecology) at the University of Winnipeg. During my undergrad, I started getting more interested in geomatics and realized I liked the spatial side of environmental work.

I like that geomatics can be both technical and creative. I like the problem solving side, and I also enjoy being able to present data in many different ways.

Indigenous rights and land are also important to me, and they influence how I think about environmental work.
